This game shall - once it's finished - provide a high intensity full body workout similar to punching games but with 4 different playing positions:
* standing
* squatting
* crunches
* pushup position

The game switches between those four positions. Try to hit the hand cues when they are between the two blue poles. The head cue has to be touched (not hit) with your head.

HOWTO:

Upon start you will see several different blocks. Touch one of them to select a level. 
To change the difficulty touch the blue pole to your right at different heights.

* Bottom: Hard
* Lower part: Medium
* High: Easy


Current features:
* incoherent soundtrack
* unbalanced gameplay
* unintuitive navigation
